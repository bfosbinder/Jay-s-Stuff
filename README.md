# Jay’s Math Lab 🧮🔬
*A playground of bite-sized experiments where numbers, code, and curiosity collide.*

Welcome to **Jay’s Math Lab**—a GitHub repo stuffed with the mini-projects, puzzles, and “what-if?” investigations of an endlessly inquisitive young mathematician.  Each directory is its own experiment, complete with code, notes, and (when it helps) a Jupyter notebook that shows the idea in motion.
